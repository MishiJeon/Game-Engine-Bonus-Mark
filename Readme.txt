I did Donkey Kong Video Game. I read/watch the gameplay


Donkey Kong is the first platform game to use jump. 
Donkey Kong requires the player to jump between gaps in the level design and jump over obstacles or approaching enemies to deal with. 
There are four stages in the game. Donkey Kong was the most complicated game during the 1980s. Donkey Kong has to climb a lot of meters to complete the stage. 
Points were awarded for collecting items such as hammers and hats. Bonus lives will give the player 7000 points. The Player will lose a life if Mario touches the player. 
The music will change due to the intensity of the game. The game has a good storyline.


Flowchart for the singleton implementation


The singleton is implemented so the enemies can move and do things in the game. 
It was implemented this way because it creates the enemy and makes it do certain actions in the game.

The singleton pattern creates the static class variable to make it easy to access modifiers and it shouldn't be a difficult task.
In Donkey Kong the singleton was implemented to make donkey kong move and be controlled by the player. 
The singleton is also used to create the enemy Mario so it makes him move and touches donkey kong to lose health.Â 


Flowchart for the observer implementation


The observer creates notifications to multiple objects about any new object or event that is created in the game. 
The purpose of the observer is to have an object in an interesting state which means it will notify when something happens to it.
The observer is used to create the game-level design and object so the map is playable without any problems so the player can enjoy the game. 
The obverse also shows the points and items players have in the user interface.
